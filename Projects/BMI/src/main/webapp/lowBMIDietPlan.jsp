    <h1>Low BMI Diet Plan</h1>
    <p>This guide provides dietary recommendations for individuals with a low BMI to help achieve a healthy weight.</p>
    
    <h2>Dietary Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Increase Caloric Intake:</strong> Aim to consume more calories than you burn. Include calorie-dense foods such as nuts, seeds, avocados, and full-fat dairy products.</li>
        <li><strong>Focus on Nutrient-Dense Foods:</strong> Incorporate a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins into your diet to ensure you're getting essential vitamins and minerals.</li>
        <li><strong>Frequent Meals and Snacks:</strong> Eat small, frequent meals throughout the day to increase overall calorie consumption. Include snacks like protein bars, trail mix, or smoothies between meals.</li>
        <li><strong>Protein-Rich Foods:</strong> Include sources of lean protein such as chicken, fish, eggs, and legumes to support muscle growth and repair.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthy Fats:</strong> Add healthy fats from sources like olive oil, nuts, and fatty fish to your meals to boost calorie intake and support overall health.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Drink plenty of fluids, but avoid excessive consumption of sugary drinks. Opt for nutrient-rich beverages like milk or fortified smoothies.</li>
        <li><strong>Include Whole Grains:</strong> Add whole grains like oatmeal, quinoa, and whole wheat bread to your diet. These foods provide complex carbohydrates and additional calories.</li>
        <li><strong>High-Calorie Smoothies:</strong> Make high-calorie smoothies with ingredients like Greek yogurt, nut butters, and fruit to add extra calories and nutrients in a convenient form.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthy Cooking Methods:</strong> Use cooking methods that enhance calorie content, such as sautéing vegetables in olive oil or adding cheese to dishes.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Monitoring:</strong> Keep track of your weight and adjust your calorie intake as needed to ensure steady, healthy weight gain.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Additional Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Consult a Professional:</strong> Speak with a healthcare provider or registered dietitian to develop a personalized plan that addresses your specific needs and health goals.</li>
        <li><strong>Track Your Progress:</strong> Regularly monitor your weight and dietary intake to ensure you’re meeting your caloric and nutritional goals.</li>
        <li><strong>Incorporate Strength Training:</strong> Engage in strength training exercises to build muscle mass and support healthy weight gain. This can help improve overall body composition.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Meal Supplements:</strong> Consider adding meal replacement shakes or protein supplements to increase your caloric intake without significantly increasing food volume.</li>
        <li><strong>Eat Mindfully:</strong> Pay attention to your hunger cues and eat slowly to allow your body to properly digest and absorb nutrients. Mindful eating can also help you enjoy your meals more.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Meal Frequency:</strong> If you struggle with large meals, try eating smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day to increase overall calorie intake.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Positive and Patient:</strong> Gaining weight, especially in a healthy way, can take time. Be patient with yourself and stay positive about your progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Empty Calories:</strong> While increasing calories, focus on nutrient-rich foods rather than foods high in sugars and unhealthy fats that offer little nutritional value.</li>
        <li><strong>Explore Different Recipes:</strong> Experiment with various recipes and cooking methods to keep your meals interesting and enjoyable, which can help you stick to your dietary plan.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Consistent:</strong> Consistency is key. Stick to your dietary and exercise plans, and make adjustments as needed based on your progress and any feedback from your healthcare provider.</li>
